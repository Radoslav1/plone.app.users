Z3C Forms TODOs
---------------

- Inline validation isn't working for the form fields (probably need
  to adjust something to deal with z3c.form fields with no prefix).
- The "Member Registration" field doesn't seem to have any effect on
  the @@register form
- The raising of errors during validation can be simplified by raising
  WidgetActionExecutionError (see https://dexterity-developer-manual.readthedocs.org/en/latest/schema-driven-forms/customising-form-behaviour/validation.html#validating-in-action-handlers)
- Death to EmptyPrefixFieldWidgets to fix Inline validation
- Move EmptyPrefixFieldWidgets to plone.z3cform or plone.app.z3cform
- Can we simplify by removing user_registration_fields, and relying on
  the schemaeditor (which isn't far behind) doing this work?

Post-merging (p.a.users and c.e.userdata)
-----------------------------------------

[ ] when this PLIP merged into master, then we need to update
    Products.CMFPlone csrf.txt doc test to work for z3c.form version of
    'register' form; one small change required: change button name from
    form.actions.register to form.buttons.register; actually we'll make it
    work for both versions

- Add collective.examples.userdata to packages tested in coredev
- Add notes to upgrade guide on what integrators need to pay attention to
- Make sure p.a.users' readme is linked to an appropriate place
  in developer.plone.org

- Some forms are neither z3c.form nor formlib:

  * @@usergroup-userprefs
  * @@usergroup-usermembership
  * @@usergroup-groupdetails
  * @@usergroup-groupmembership
  * @@manage-group-portlets
  * @@manage-group-dashboard
  * @@usergroup-groupprefs

  Fine for this PLIP, but worth noting
