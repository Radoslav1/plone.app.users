Z3C Forms TODOs
---------------

- The "Member Registration" field doesn't seem to have any effect on
  the @@register form
- The raising of errors during validation can be simplified by raising
  WidgetActionExecutionError (see
  https://dexterity-developer-manual.readthedocs.org/en/latest/schema-driven-forms/customising-form-behaviour/validation.html#validating-in-action-handlers)
- Can we simplify by removing user_registration_fields, and relying on
  the schemaeditor (which isn't far behind) doing this work?

Post-merging (p.a.users and c.e.userdata)
-----------------------------------------

- Add collective.examples.userdata to packages tested in coredev
- Add notes to upgrade guide on what integrators need to pay attention to
- Make sure p.a.users' readme is linked to an appropriate place
  in developer.plone.org

- Some forms are neither z3c.form nor formlib:

  * @@usergroup-userprefs
  * @@usergroup-usermembership
  * @@usergroup-groupdetails
  * @@usergroup-groupmembership
  * @@manage-group-portlets
  * @@manage-group-dashboard
  * @@usergroup-groupprefs

  Fine for this PLIP, but worth noting
