Z3C Forms TODOs
---------------

[ ] check and improve test coverage
[ ] pull changes from mainstream master branch and apply to z3c form
    versions
[ ] update collective.examples.userdata to use z3c form versions
[ ] update README.txt
[ ] when this PLIP merged into master, then we need to update
    Products.CMFPlone csrf.txt doc test to work for z3c.form version of
    'register' form; one small change required: change button name from
    form.actions.register to form.buttons.register
